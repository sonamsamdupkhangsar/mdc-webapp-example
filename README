This is a sample application demonstrating the use of SLF4J Message Diagnostic Context information for logging contextual information.
You probably want to use a interceptor or a filter to engage the logging of contextual information in the inbound request and clear
on the outbound response.  


HOW TO RUN
--------------
execute: mvn package && java -jar target/mdc*.jar

go to browser: http://localhost:8080/
